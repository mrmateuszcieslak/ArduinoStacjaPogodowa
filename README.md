#ArduinoStacjaPogodowa â€“ IoT-Based Weather Station

ArduinoStacjaPogodowa is a my thesis built on an Arduino board and an ESP32 microcontroller, which handles communication and data transmission. The system collects real-time environmental data from multiple sensors, providing comprehensive atmospheric analysis.
Key Features:

âœ… Real-time Monitoring: Continuously gathers and processes environmental data.

âœ… Sensor Integration: Measures multiple weather and air quality parameters.

âœ… IoT Communication: Utilizes ESP32 for efficient data transmission.

Collected Data:

ðŸ“Œ Air Temperature & Humidity

ðŸ“Œ Atmospheric Pressure

ðŸ“Œ Carbon Monoxide (CO) Levels

ðŸ“Œ Air Quality Index (AQI)

ðŸ“Œ Particulate Matter (PM 2.5 & PM 10)

Technologies Used:

    Arduino for sensor data acquisition
    
    ESP32 for wireless communication

    Various environmental sensors for accurate measurements

This project demonstrates expertise in IoT, embedded systems, and sensor-based data collection.
